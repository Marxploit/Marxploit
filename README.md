Im a PC System Analyst trying to break into the field of Cybersecurity.

## Objective

I began my journey as a Computer Science student before transitioning into cybersecurity, where I ultimately earned my degree. This GitHub page serves as both a reflection of what I learned during my studies and a platform to continue developing new skills while maintaining and sharpening the ones Iâ€™ve already gained.
